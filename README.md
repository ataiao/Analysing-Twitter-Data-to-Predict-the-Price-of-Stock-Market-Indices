# Capstone Individual Project (5-week timeframe):

## Analysing Twitter Data to Predict the Price of Stock Market Indices (FTSE)

The ability to predict asset prices would be highly valuable for investors and other parties. Consequently, the field of stock market prediction has received a great deal of attention from both academia and businesses. Behavioural finance research shows that our emotion and mood plays a large and important role in our financial decision-making.Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the public sentiment, mood and opinion may affect the stock market prices and movements. For this project i aim to find out if sentiment extracted from Twitter can be used to predict the direction of Returns of a Stock Market Index.

## Abstract
The five-week final project for my General Assembly data science immersive programme. I built a model that predicted (FTSE) Index Stock Returns using Twitter Sentiment. The first step involved constructing the dataframe. I scraped Twitter and conducted Vader sentiment analysis on the dataset, I then downloaded the FTSE historical data, created the Returns column, and joined the two dataframes together to get the final dataset. 
The second step involves the application of modelling techniques on the dataset, I applied Linear Regression modelling. The results highlighted that this was a poor model, the predicted score was lower than the baseline (0.0.0022320050_LR). From a statistical point of view its a pretty bad model, but it is important to look from an economic perspective. 

For the final part of the project, I conducted a backtest and devised a trading strategy that predicted the direction and return of the FTSE index. I established cumulative P&L scores, which showed that from an economic perspective that it is a good course of action.

## Objectives
Five-week final project for my General Assembly Data Science Immersive programme. 

I conducted an exploratory study; The aim of which was to investigate if sentiment expressed on Twitter has an effect on Price of Individual Stock Market Indices (FTSE).
- Can Twitter Data be used to predict the Price of an Index up to one day ahead?
- Is Twitter a suitable data source to help forecast future stock market movement?
## Hypothesis
1. Twitter Sentiment reflects the mood of the market.
2. Twitter can be used to predict the direction of future stock market movements.
