# Analysing-Twitter-Data-to-Predict-the-Price-of-Stock-Market-Indices

The final 5 weeks of the course were spent working on a solo Capstone project, where I built a model that predicted (FTSE) Index Stock Returns using Twitter Sentiment. First, I began the process of getting the DataFrame. I scraped Twitter Data, and conducted VADER sentiment analysis on the dataset. Followed by EDA, Data Visualisation, consolidating and cleaning the data.
 
 Second step was to apply modelling techniques on the dataset and analyse the model’s performance against the Baseline. The results of the Linear Regression model highlighted that this was a poor model to use, as the score was lower than the baseline. Be that as it may, I ‘backtested’ and devised a trading strategy that predicted the direction and return of the stock index. I managed to get cumulative P&L scores, which showed from an economic perspective that it is a good course of action. 
 
In summary, I found that Twitter sentiment reflects the mood of the market, and that Twitter can be used to predict future stock market movements. Moreover, the trading strategy worked, through ‘backtesting’ I found it is possible to generate profits over time.
